.. _`Deep Dive`: deep_dive.rst

This section is aimed at general users, who would like to learn how to use Aikit, and are less concerned about how it all works under the hood ðŸ”§

The `Deep Dive`_ section is more targeted at potential contributors, and at users who would like to dive deeper into the weeds of the frameworkðŸŒ±, and gain a better understanding of what is actually going on behind the scenes ðŸŽ¬

If that sounds like you, feel free to check out the `Deep Dive`_ section after you've gone through the higher level overview which is covered in this *design* section!

| So, starting off with our higher level *design* section, Aikit can fulfill two distinct purposes:
|
| 1. enable automatic code conversions between frameworks
| 2. serve as a new ML framework with multi-framework support
|
| The Aikit codebase can then be split into three categories which are labelled (a),
| (b) and (c) below, and can be further split into 8 distinct submodules.
| The eight submodules are Aikit API, Backend Handler, Backend API, Aikit Array,
| Aikit Container, Aikit Stateful API, and finally Frontend API.

| All eight fall into one of the three categories as follows:
